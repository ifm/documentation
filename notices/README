This folder contains snippets of documentation that can be included in multiple places in the documentation. 
This is done to avoid duplicating information and to keep a single source of truth.

To include a notice in another document, use:
````
```{include} /path/to/document.md
```
````

Note that to include a document located in a parent directory, you have to include the path from root. In our case, root is /documentation. So the full path would be /documentation/notices/notice.md.
