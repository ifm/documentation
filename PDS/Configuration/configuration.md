## State

A PDS application can be configured to either `CONF` or `IDLE` state, implying that there is no `RUN` state. For PDS, the imager will be triggered once a command is issued (akin to [software trigger](../../Technology/3D/triggering.md) for normal camera acquisition).

## Commands

### `nop`
No operation. This is the default command value for PDS application and after processing the given command the value returns to `nop`.

### `getPallet`
Triggers the algorithm to detect the pallet in the camera's field of view. There are three parameters to configure the `getPallet` command.
1. `depthHint`: approximate distance (in meters along the x-axis) that the camera is expected to be away from the pallet, set to **-1** by default to use automatic distance detection. Note that this works best for pallets with full loads and will most likely fail for empty pallets.
2. `palletIndex`: pallet type index. ifm has developed PDS based on standardized pallets (block, stringer or EPAL).
3. `palletOrder`: sets the order of pallets based on their score (height from floor).

For more details, refer to [the `getPallet` documentation](../GetPallet/getPallet.md).

### `getRack`
Triggers the industrial rack recognition algorithm, taking into account the following parameters:
1. `clearingVolume`: The bounding box parameters in the camera's FOV where the position of the rack is expected.
2. `depthHint`: Approximate distance (in meters along the x-axis) that the camera is expected to be away from the rack. The default value is `1.8 m`.
3. `horizontalDropPosition`: Selection of the horizontal drop position. The user must specify the upright to PDS algorithm to detect the pose of a rack.
4. `verticalDropPosition`: Selection of the vertical drop position. The user must specify the drop position for the PDS algorithm.
5. `zHint`: Approximate distance from the center of the coordinate system to the beam of the rack.

For more details, refer to [the `getRack` documentation](../GetRack/getRack.md).
:::

### `getItem`
Triggers the algorithm to find the customized item (for example: Dolly/Trolley). This functionality is only available for certain items. Please contact ifm support to add a customer item. The `getItem` can be configured with following parameters.
1. `depthHint`: Approximate distance (in meters along the x-axis) that the camera is expected to be away from the pallet. By default it is set to **-1** to use an automatic detection of the distance.
2. `itemIndex`: The index of the item type.
3. `itemOrder`: Set the order of detected items (if multiple items are detected) based on their `score`/`height` (height from ground).

:::{note}
For more details, refer to [the `getItem` documentation](../GetItem/getItem.md).
:::

### `volCheck`
Triggers the algorithm to detect the number of valid pixels in a user-defined region of interest.
1. `xMax`: Maximum bounding box dimension of VOI along X-Axis.
2. `xMin`: Minimum bounding box dimension of VOI along X-Axis.
3. `yMax`: Maximum bounding box dimension of VOI along Y-Axis.
4. `yMin`: Minimum bounding box dimension of VOI along Y-Axis.
5. `zMax`: Maximum bounding box dimension of VOI along Z-Axis.
6. `zMin`: Minimum bounding box dimension of VOI along Z-Axis.
