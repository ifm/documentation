# List of ideas for detailed case study articles:

- Dealing with highly reflective objects
- Outdoors and semi-outdoors cases: sunlight interference
- Improving the framerate (?)
- Calibration, world coordinates, reference frame
- Point cloud concatenation
- 2D3D visualization (?)
- Configuring the platform according to the scene (bring some intelligence)
- Deploy code to the platform (docker integration)
- MPI: mitigating it with coded mod range + offset (?)
