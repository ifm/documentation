# List of ideas for detailed case study articles:

- Stray-light: dealing with highly reflective objects
- Outdoors and semi-outdoors cases: sunlight interference
- Calibration, world coordinates, reference frame
- Point cloud concatenation
- Deploy code to the platform (docker integration)
- MPI: mitigating it with coded mod range + offset (?)
- Detailed explanation of confidence image (possible values and their meanings)
- Cross-talk: hopping frequencies? Different channels? What to use for a robot fleet? A scan tunnel?
- Detecting very dark objects

- Improving the framerate (?)
- 2D3D visualization (?)
- Configuring the platform according to the scene (bring some intelligence)
